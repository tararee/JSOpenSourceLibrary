//VARIABLES
//defined with var 

var myVariable;
//cannot start with numbers!
//end it with a semicolon! It's a statement!

//give variables a value
myVariable = 100;
//you can name the value and set the value
//at the same time:

var myVarTara = "Tara";
//you can change the value as many times as you want


myVarTara = "Tara Ree";
//and it will update because of the way JS works.
//DYNAMIC TYPES
//you can change from one type (a string above) to another
//(an integer below), unlike other languages.
myVarTara = 33;

//you really shouldn't though
