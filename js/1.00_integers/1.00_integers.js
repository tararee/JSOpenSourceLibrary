//Variables are containers for different values.
//In JavaScript, one type of value is an integer, or number.


var numberOne = 1 ;
var numberTwo = 2 ;
var numberThree = numberOne + numberTwo;
console.log(numberThree)


//You can add integers to a pre-exisiting variable.
var myCupsOfCoffee = 3;
var myCupsOfCoffee = myCupsOfCoffee + 1
console.log(myCupsOfCoffee);



//An easy shortcut for adding the number 1 to another variable 
//is adding "++" to the end of the number."
//var numberTwo = 1 + 1;
//var numberThree = 1++;
//console.log(numberTwo);


//You can do basic arithmetic with integers in JS
//operators include +,-,/,*,%

//Addition
//var x = 1;
//var y = 2;
//var z = x + y;

//Subtraction

//var x = 1;
//var y = 2;
//var z = x - y;

//Multiplication

//var x = 1;
//var y = 2;
//var z = x * y;

//Division

//var x = 1;
//var y = 2;
//var z = x / y;

//Modulus
//The modulus divides an integer by the following integer
//and returns the remainder

console.log("Hello, World!");


//Integers & Variables
var x = 1;
console.log(x);

// Variables Think about it like algebra
//JK, don't do that, you failed algebra :(
x = 3;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
console.log(z);

//Name variable with camel casing and try not
//to use names that JS reserves, like function or
//math or something
var myAge = 33;
var birthYear = 1982;

var timesAttackedByMonkeys = 2; 


var timesAttackedByMonkeys = (z * timesAttackedByMonkeys);

//Operators
//Mathy stuff, they're called operators!
1 + 1;
2 - 2;
3 * 3;
4 / 4;

//Shorthand operator
myAge += 1;

//same as 
myAge = myAge + 1;
//which I think would be a good thing to set on something like, you know, a birthday

//Same thing with
//subtraction, 

myAge -= 10;
//following is a string, which we haven't
//gotten to, but just go with it:
console.log("In my head I am " + myAge);


//So you are just taking your variable (myAge),
//and setting adding, subtracting, etc. the proceeding
//number to it.

var myAge = 33;
myAge += 100;
myAge = myAge + 100;
myAge -= 100;
myAge = myAge - 100;
console.log(myAge);
//same same^

myAge *= 9;
myAge /= 7;
console.log(myAge);


//MODULUS
//A modulus divides one integer by
//another, then returns the remainder.
//For the life of me, I can't figure out why I would use
//it. 
//Until I figure that out, it will just remind me
//of how I got my first D on a test in 6th grade
//and Mr. Tate let us play dodgeball because
//he could tell I was really sad and that was just
//really nice.
console.log(100 % 5); 
console.log(10 % 4);
console.log(10 % 3);
console.log(22 % 5);
/* I like to comment
out all the lines as I go with
the double-slashes,
but if I go back later and do it (like to temporarily
"delete" a section of code to see 
what disappears or something),I use
these things for larger blocks of text.
Maybe there's a name for them, but to me they look like
a katamari trying to roll up a plank that's too big for it.
This works in JavaScript and CSS, in html it's <!--
