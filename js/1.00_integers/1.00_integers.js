//Variables are containers for different values.
//In JavaScript, one type of value is an integer, or number.


var numberOne = 1 ;
var numberTwo = 2 ;
var numberThree = numberOne + numberTwo;
console.log(numberThree)


//You can add integers to a pre-exisiting variable.
var myCupsOfCoffee = 3;
var myCupsOfCoffee = myCupsOfCoffee + 1
console.log(myCupsOfCoffee);



//An easy shortcut for adding the number 1 to another variable 
//is adding "++" to the end of the number."
//var numberTwo = 1 + 1;
//var numberThree = 1++;
//console.log(numberTwo);


//You can do basic arithmetic with integers in JS
//operators include +,-,/,*,%

//Addition
//var x = 1;
//var y = 2;
//var z = x + y;

//Subtraction

//var x = 1;
//var y = 2;
//var z = x - y;

//Multiplication

//var x = 1;
//var y = 2;
//var z = x * y;

//Division

//var x = 1;
//var y = 2;
//var z = x / y;

//Modulus
//The modulus divides an integer by the following integer
//and returns the remainder
