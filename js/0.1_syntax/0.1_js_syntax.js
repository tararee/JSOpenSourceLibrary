// CASE-SENSITIVITY
// myFunction(){} cannot be called by myFunction();

// STATEMENTS all end with semi-colons
// alert(); You can end without one, but if anything came after
//that function, it would explode

//spaces and whitespace are unimportant

//COMMENTS are /* for a lot of space*/ or //for a line or two

//SYNCHRONICITY
//Statements run top to bottom
//
